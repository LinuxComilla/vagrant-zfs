# Vagrant-ZFS

Vagrant-ZFS is a plugin for [Vagrant][1] to automate cloning and sharing
ZFS filesystems from the host machine to a guest VM. This is useful for
things like bringing up multiple VMs to test database clustering without
requiring you to manually copy large amounts of data into multiple
locations on your host machine or syncing data from host to VMs.

This project is still in the very early stages, so proceed with caution.
